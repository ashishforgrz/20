Intro to objects -
=> Variable which can store multiple values
=> Normal variable can store only 1 value, So by using object we can store multiple values in variable
=> Entity with properties and type


Properties in JS -
=> Named values are properties of the object
=> Store any number of properties that we want
=> collection of unordered properties


Object Method -
=> JS Method - Actions that can be performed in object
=> Functions stored as object properties
=> A function that is property of the object is method
1. Object.assign() - This method is used to copy own properties from a source object to a target object
2. Object.create() - This method is used to create a new object with the specified object and properties
3. object.entries() - This method returns an array with arrays of the key and value pairs
4. Object.values() - This method returns an array of values
5. Object.isFrozen() - This method checks if the object was frozen
6. Object.isSealed() - This method checks if the object was sealed
7. Object.is() - This method checks if the two values are same or not
8. Object.defineProperties() - This method defines the properties of the object
